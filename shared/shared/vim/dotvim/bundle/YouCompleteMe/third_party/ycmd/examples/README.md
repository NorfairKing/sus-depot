# ycmd example client

First make sure you have built ycmd; see the top-level README for details.

Then install all the Python requirements with [pip][] (run as admin/super user):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors
```

Then just run `./example_client.py` from the console. It will start `ycmd`, send
it some example requests while logging the full HTTP request & response and then
shut everything down.

The best way to learn how to use ycmd is to play around with the example client;
tweak the code, send other requests etc.
