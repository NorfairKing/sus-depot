# OS X-specific installation

# OS X comes with 2 versions of python by default, and a neat system
# (versioner) to switch between them:
#   /usr/bin/python2.7 - python 2.7
#   /usr/bin/python2.6 - python 2.6
#
# We just set the system default to match it
# http://stackoverflow.com/q/6998545
defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version ${YCMD_PYTHON_VERSION}

# virtualenv is not installed by default on OS X under python2.6, and we don't
# have sudo, so we install it manually. There is no "latest" link, so we have
# to install a specific version.
VENV_VERSION=13.1.2
